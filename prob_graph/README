naming convention:
    -ONE arm: data are from one-arm trials
        -SIM data: data are from simulated robot
            -success trials: data are from success trials
                SIM data SF probability graph of trial *.png 
                SIM data SF probability graph of trial *.eps
                SIM data SF probability graph of trial *.txt: these files belong to success/failure classification

                SIM data state probability graph of trial *.png 
                SIM data state probability graph of trial *.eps
                SIM data state probability graph of trial *.txt: these files belong to state classification

            -failure trials: data are from failure trials
                SIM data SF probability graph of trial *.png 
                SIM data SF probability graph of trial *.eps
                SIM data SF probability graph of trial *.txt: these files belong to success/failure classification

                /* no state classification for failure trials... */

        -REAL data:
            ...
            /* same as SIM data */
